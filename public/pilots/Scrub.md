At age 42, Walter was the definition of unremarkable. Meek, conflict-averse, and prone to apologizing even when he’s in the right, Walter had spent the past decade of his life as a low-level cog trapped in the bureaucratic machinery of Colonial Capital, the least reputable bank in the entirety of humanity’s far-flung diaspora. Walter’s days were a slow blur of financial reports and predatory loan approvals -- an irony not lost on him, considering he was one of the many souls indebted to the same institution. 

Long hours spent hunched over a flickering terminal, parsing figures that seemed to silently mock him for once daring to have aspirations. He knew how the rest of his life would unfold: quiet, unseen, working off a debt that would never truly disappear. 

But fate had other plans for Walter. Or rather, the unregistered NHP overseeing Colonial Capital’s vast web of employees had other plans: Walter would pilot a mech.  

Without warning, Walter was reassigned to Special Collections, the most dangerous department in the bank. Colonial Capital financed everything -- from doomed business ventures to genocidal warlords -- and when their clients defaulted, diplomacy wasn’t always an option. Sometimes, debts required mechanized killing machines. 
The department only handled the most dangerous of accounts: warlords, cartels, rebel militias. Clients who often had their own mech cavalries and no intention of handing over a single manna. When Special Collections was deployed, the mandate was simple: recover assets, repossess anything of value, and collect the interest in blood.

Walter Winkle was, by any reasonable metric, the least qualified person for the job. His only experience with mechs came in the form of scale-model kits -- the plastic kind, meticulously assembled and painted in the dim solitude of his single-room housing unit. But that wasn’t going to be enough to save him. 

Saying no wasn’t an option. Not unless he wanted to settle his debt in organs instead. 

So, after a quiet prayer to whatever might be listening, Walter reported for basic mech pilot training. A few weeks in the simulator, enough to make him basically competent, and then, without ceremony, his first assignment arrived.
