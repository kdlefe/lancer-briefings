Nepheli Rex-Montague is a navigator by trade, more accustomed to charting the vast unknown than running courier jobs. This time, however, she’s been assigned to oversee the secure and confidential transport of cargo aboard The Tallgrass.

She carries herself with a mix of refinement and restlessness, a product of her noble ties and her own defiance of them. There’s an undeniable intelligence behind her eyes, but she’s still learning that not every problem can be solved with manna or confidence.
