Toska is native to the planet Aldora, a jungle planet located on the outer rim. The planet was Earth-like, and the climate was almost entirely tropical. There were cities and technology, advanced enough to be on the Union’s radar. Aldorans also engaged in politics, and struggled with religious conflict. While high-tech and modernized, Aldoran’s were very nature-loving and had advanced means of keeping their planet clean and well maintained, with very low pollution. The planet itself was known for being a great place to vacation.

A religious group deemed themselves to be followers of ‘Nox’, taking refuge underneath the cities in the sewers. Nox was a malicious NHP that poisoned the minds of Toska’s family, specifically her father, who was a politician of Aldora. Nox pushed the idea of ascending from human flesh and put values into transhumanism. Burning someone alive if they did not agree with their ideals became a ritualistic right of passage for some followers, as if they were releasing the mind of a human being so that it could ascend through a means of purification. During one final plight to purge the entire planet, after Toska’s father was not able to hold his political status (due to his beliefs), Toska rescued a union soldier and found herself fleeing the planet with them, and many other civilians. During the purge, Toska was recognized for her ability to pilot a mech, and was recruited into the Union.
