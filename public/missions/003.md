# Mission // #003
## Floodgate

Patience wants the sqaud to investigate the source of the signal and find out who is hijacking the colony's subalterns and drones. This mission has rapidly changed from a simple investigation into a fighting retreat as the squad tries to staunch the flow of the Machine's horde and fight their way back to Evergreen.

# Goals

# Reserves
- 1x Colony Drop
- 3x Backup Batteries
- 3x Bahadur's Reserves
- 1x Scouting
