# Union Log // Early Summer 5014u
## Machine Shephard
After the squad spoke with D'thall Ordo on behalf of the **Hercynian United Cities Rangers** in the interests of peace, Patience turned the squad's focus on the signal that has been **haunting** them and **hijacking** Evergreen subalterns. They tasked you with investigating the **source** of the signal and finding out where the subalterns are heading-- while they batten down to cycle.


## Sepulcher
After arriving at the source of the signal, the squad came across **thousands** of subalterns **tirelessly digging** a pit hundreds of meters across. A sudden **eruption** gave way to radiation and the unbridling of the **Machine Horde** army, a force that began sweeping across the region and that pushed the squad into retreat.


## Patience, Patience
At the "behest" of **Edena Ji**, the squad was tasked with **evacuation** of Merricktown, Liu Maize, and the surrounding Gray Towns. The squad coordinated to help evacuate as many people as possible, saving Liu Maize from **siege**; putting out **forest fires** in unfarmed forests; helping families stranded by a **bridge collapse**; helping out Davenriche's squad as they were **surrounded**; dealing with an **abandoned Broadcast unit**; stopped **looters** from ransacking; and putting to rest a **charged hostage situation**.
