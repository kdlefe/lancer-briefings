## Machine Shepard
After speaking with D'thall Ordo on behalf of the **Hercynian United Cities Rangers** in the interests of peace, Patience has turned the squad's focus on the signal that has been **haunting** him and **hijacking** Evergreen subalterns. They have tasked you with investigating the **source** of the signal and finding out where the subalterns are heading-- while they batten down to cycle.

## Sepulcher
Upon arriving at the source of the signal, the squad came across **thousands** of subalterns **tirelessly digging** a pit hundreds of meters across. A sudden **eruption** gave way to radiation and the unbridling of the **Machine Horde** army, a force that began sweeping across the region and pushing the squad into retreat.
