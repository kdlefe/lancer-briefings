# Union Log // Late Spring 5014u
## Council Chambers
As spring drew to an end, Patience convened a **defense council**, summoning the squad, Brava Hadura, and a few other militia officers to review intelligence. During this meeting, Patience shared their report on **finalizing a connection to a meteorological satellite**, which would allow the colony to **capture** up-to-date **images** of the planet. The squad was told to **remain vigilant** against the raiders.


## Night Strike
Before the squad was able to continue their efforts against the raiders, they were woken up by an **attack** on the colony itself. The attack proved to be a **distraction** after the attackers disappeared back into the night and reports of a separate attack on the colony's **reactors** began coming in.

## Reactor Defense
Evergreen's reactors, the **salvaged engines** from the colonial ship that first brought Patience and the seeds of the colonists with it, were attacked by the raiders. The squad had to make repairs on the move, **arriving just in time** to stop an enemy chassis from **destroying** the second reactor.

## Regret
The night had one more trial in store for the squad: **Regret**, the reconstituted skeleton of a mech from 500 years ago. The **berserk** chassis tore through Evergreen's perimeter and brought a squad to lay siege on the **colony's printer**. The squad managed to hold Regret in a park long enough for the pilot to come to their senses, triggering a **reactor meltdown** to keep the chassis from doing any more **harm to innocents**.

## Downstream
After a **weeks-long lull** in combat following the attack on the colony, the squad is hailed on long-range communications by **D'thall Ordo**, the leader of the **Hercynian Rangers** and unofficial representative of the **Hercynian United Cities**. D'thall **apologized** for the attacks, telling the squad that Regret's pilot had taken command of a unit **without authorization** from HUC command, and pleaded for a day of **peace** so that she could pull back her remaining rangers. D'thall told the squad that the Hercynian Rangers were **no longer** the colony's threat; it was time to look to the **machines**.
